# 'Forbidden Planet' Cured my Imposter Syndrome

## Abstract

Come with me on an adventure with a heroic robot, a mad scientist, a feminist, a pilot, and our monster: imposter syndrome. Let me share how a sci-fi movie from 1956, starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, taught me how to recognize imposter syndrome not as the monster hellbent on ruining my romance with an ever-evolving frontend ecosystem, but as a tool to prevent burnout.

## Details

By suppressing our negative emotions like fear, embarrassment, anger, frustration, and exhaustion, we are feeding our own monster (Imposter Syndrome). By facing those feelings head-on, and allowing them to be satiated by asking questions, taking time off, and letting our interests guide our learning, we develop a healthier relationship with our career.

Essentially, imposter syndrome comes from within. Not from tech changing quickly, or from others knowing more than us. It comes from being so afraid to sacrifice our pride that we, in essence, bring our own fears into being.

I will use scenes from the movie to tell a relatable story of how we often treat the symptoms, but not the cause, and how we can use those symptoms as an alert system for ourselves.

## Pitch

Imposter syndrome is rampant amongst engineers. I'd like to take a humorous and sci-fi inspired look at what imposter syndrome really is. The sooner we can identify the signs, the easier it is to turn it into a self-diagnostic tool. Instead of reacting to it by burning out, we can adjust our responses for a healthier relationship with our careers.
