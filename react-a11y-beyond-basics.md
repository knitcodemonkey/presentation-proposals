# React Accessibiliy: Beyond the Basics

## Abstract

Accessibility in React has been a hot topic in the last few years, but in this talk, we'll be going beyond the basics. 
We'll explore a data-driven perspective to convince the business to invest in accessibility, and then dive into the details of accessibility testing. We'll use lighthouse to audit applications, discover how to use the axe browser extensions as an educational tool, and explore how to add axe-core to your automated testing suite. You'll leave armed and ready to add accessibility features to your application and make the web a more inclusive place.
