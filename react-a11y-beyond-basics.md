# React Accessibiliy: Beyond the Basics

## Abstract

Accessibility in React has been a hot topic in the last few years, but in this talk, we'll be going beyond the basics. We'll explore a data-driven perspective to convince the business to invest in accessibility, then dive into the details of accessibility testing. 

We'll use lighthouse to audit applications, educate ourselves with the axe browser extensions, incorporate eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y into our lint process, and add axe-core to our automated testing suite. You'll leave prepared to add accessibility features to your application.
