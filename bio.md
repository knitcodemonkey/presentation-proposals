Jen Luker has four kids, two cats and a wonderful husband, all of whom understand her need to speak in programming jargon while spinning and knitting something to calm her overclocked mind.

# Front End Developer Bio:
When Jen Luker isn't knitting, she is a senior software engineer with Deseret Digital Media. Over a decade of programming experience has given her mad skillz in styling Internet Explorer to work like the rest of the web, and a knack for picking out the missing comma in a screen full of code.

# Github Bio:
Jen Luker is a senior software engineer with Deseret Digital Media, and knitter extraordinaire, who is always looking for a cleaner way.
