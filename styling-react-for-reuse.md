# Styling React for Reuse

## Abstract:
We've all installed a component only to discover the burden of styling it to match our brand far outweighs the benefits. 
Learn the difference between styling for functionality and beauty, use naming conventions to easily find elements, and 
then use that knowledge to make your components more widely usable without all the pain.

## Details:
All code will be pre-written, and will run without an internet connection. After the talk, codepens will be available 
for reference. 

* The good, the bad, and the ugly
    * Load a component, try to fit it into my page, and realize how painful it is. 
    * Try another component, one that works. One that doesn't hurt. 
    
* Start from a bare-bones, unstylized component, and style it while discussing 
    * Functional versus lipstick styling
    * Inline styles versus stylesheets, and how to use both
    * Class naming conventions such as BEM for easily identifying elements to style
    * Reusable components are oftentimes not used for their original purpose
    
* Conclusion
    * I will show a page refreshing with multiple stylesheets, similar to http://www.csszengarden.com, to illustrate 
    how our newly stylized component can be reskinned in wildly different ways, while keeping it's functionality intact.  

## Pitch:
The front-end programming sphere has exploded in recent years. Between state-based components, class naming conventions, 
and the inline versus stylesheet wars, it's difficult to wrap your head around your own components, let alone reusing 
them. My goal is to take all that information and distill it down into an easy to digest discussion for those who are 
looking to standardize their own components, or release their first components for public use.
