# Proposals

## [Styling React For Reuse](https://github.com/knitcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/styling-react-for-reuse.md)
We've all installed a component only to discover the burden of styling it to match our brand far outweighs the benefits. 
Learn the difference between styling for functionality and beauty, use naming conventions to easily find elements, and 
then use that knowledge to make your components more widely usable without all the pain.

## [Accessibility: The Sprint-Filler Way](https://github.com/knitcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/accessibility-the_sprint-filler_way.md)

We see so much information about incorporating accessibility (or a11y) features, but the task seems so daunting, or just not that pressing. Why is a11y important? Where do you get started? What are the quick wins that will give you the biggest bang for your buck? How can we break this down into smaller, sprint-filler-sized pieces? I will answer these questions, share some resources, and discuss the importance of why everyone should focus on a11y. Though this talk is more focused on web and mobile, there are topics discussed that reach far beyond those platforms. Developers, designers, managers, and more can learn how to take the overwhelming task and turn them into smaller, more accessible ones.

## [How 'Forbidden Planet' Cured My Imposter Syndrome](https://github.com/knitcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/forbidden-planet-cured-my-imposter-syndrome.md)
Come with me on an adventure with a heroic robot, a mad scientist, a feminist, a pilot, and our monster, imposter syndrome. Let me share how a sci-fi movie from 1956, starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, taught me how to recognize imposter syndrome not as the monster hellbent on ruining my romance with an ever-evolving development ecosystem, but as a tool to prevent burnout.

## [Weaving Tapestries of Code](https://github.com/knitcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/weaving-tapestries-of-code.md)
Yarns, fibers, and fabrics. You have more in common with the weavers of yesteryear than you realize. In this expedition into the past of fiber arts, we'll explore how our coding art is the continuation of our ancestors at the loom, how you can learn lessons from their patterns, and maybe a thing or two about that nice sweater you're wearing.

## [Wheelchairs on Mars: AR, VR, and A11y](https://github.com/knitcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/wheelchairs-on-mars.md)
With AR and VR utilizing mobile devices, the technology is on the verge of exploding into every home, school, mall and doctor's office. This talk challenges universal design, and explores how users with limitations interact differently with the hardware we develop, and the virtual worlds we create.
