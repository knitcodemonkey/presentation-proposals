## <a href="https://github.com/knittingcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/styling-react-for-reuse.md">Styling React For Reuse</a>
<p>We've all installed a component only to discover the burden of styling it to match our brand far outweighs the benefits. 
Learn the difference between styling for functionality and beauty, use naming conventions to easily find elements, and 
then use that knowledge to make your components more widely usable without all the pain.</p>

## <a href="https://github.com/knittingcodemonkey/presentation-proposals/blob/master/accessibility-the_sprint-filler_way.md">Accessibility: The Sprint-Filler Way</a>
<p>We see so much information about incorporating accessibility (or a11y) features, but the task seems so daunting, or just not that pressing. Why is a11y important? Where do you get started? What are the quick wins that will give you the biggest bang for your buck? How can we break this down into smaller, sprint-filler-sized pieces? I will answer these questions, share some resources for both web and mobile, and discuss the importance of why everyone should focus on a11y. Developers, designers, managers, and more can learn how to take the overwhelming task and turn them into smaller, more accessible ones.</p>
