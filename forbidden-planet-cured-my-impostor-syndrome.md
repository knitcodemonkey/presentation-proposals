# Forbidden Planet Cured my Impostor Syndrome

## Abstract

Come with me on an adventure with a heroic robot, a mad scientist, a feminist, a pilot, and our monster, impostor syndrome. Let me share how a sci-fi movie from 1956, starring Leslie Nielson, taught me how to recognize impostor syndrome not as the monster hellbent on ruining my romance with an ever-moving development ecosystem, but as the realization of my own pride. 

## Details

By suppressing our negative emotions like fear, embarrassment, anger, frustration, exhaustion, etc, we are feeding our own monster (Impostor Syndrome). By facing those feelings head on, and allowing them to be satiated by asking questions, taking time off, and letting our interests guide our learning, we develop a healthier relationship with our career.

Essentially, imposter syndrome comes from within. Not from tech changing quickly, or from others knowing more than us. It comes from being so afraid to sacrifice our pride that we, in essence, bring our own fears into being.

## Pitch

Impostor syndrome is rampant amongst engineers. I'd like to take a humorous and sci-fi inspired look at what impostor syndrome really is. The sooner we can identify the signs, the easier it is to turn it into a self-diagnostic tool. Instead of reacting to it by burning out, we can adjust our responses for a healthier relationship with our careers.
