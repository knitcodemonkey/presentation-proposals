# Wheelchairs on Mars: AR, VR and A11y

## Abstract:
As ARKit and VR technologies are in their infancy, we have the opportunity to develop accessibility as a standard from the very beginning. This talk uses thought experiments to explore how users with limitations interact differently with the hardware we develop, and the virtual worlds we create.

### Amazing AR and VR Uses:

* https://www.vrhealthgroup.com/products/vrphysio/ - Things we can learn from Physical Therapy VR. 
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hKfdgA0BEk - Oculus Rift Blade Runner like city and flying car

   * Accomodates different heights, but what options are available for assistive mobility tech like wheelchairs and crutches?    * What about plus-size users?

### Problems with Universal Design
* Blind users don't need a visual layer, but an observational layer is desired
* Standing requirements are impossible for those in wheelchairs, or bedridden
* Physical mobility limitations need to use a controller instead of walking and touching
* World dimension scaling based on height and armspan of user?

### Hardware concerns
* Glasses wearers
* Limited mobility users that can't put on or take off the equipment by themselves
    * Blinded by device, or stuck staring at flashing or snowing screens until someone can help
    * Can't reset the program without taking off headset
    * Corded headsets are a safety hazard: fire, strangulation, constriction

### Software considerations
* Height constraints are an issue. 
   * If something is high up, or requires long arms, a person of short stature can't reach (such as a child, or my 4'11" tall aunt)
   * If something is on the ground, there are users that have difficulty standing up (POTS, Elderly, Injured)
* Auditory Sensitivities
    * Audio can be intense for users without auditory triggers, but should be soothing for those that do
    * 360-degree sound is particularly important for users that can't constantly be spinning around to watch their back
* Color indication considerations for color blind users
* Sign/Text/Subtitle reader for illiterate or blind users

## Pitch:

How do wheelchairs navigate other worlds? Can bedridden patients, requiring physical therapy, make use of games to make the experience more enjoyable? How can blind users navigate through an interstellar battle? What accommodations need to be made for children? With AR and VR utilizing mobile devices, the technology is on the verge of exploding into every home, school, mall and doctor's office. Teaching developers, designers, and product owners what kind of questions to ask when it comes to accessibility will start this technology off with our best foot forward. 

Growing up with a deaf mother, and a special-needs sister, instilled in me the desire to help make technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their impediments. I've brought this passion into my day job by advocating for accessibility changes with my own scrum team, and sharing that knowledge with my company as a whole. I have recently begun sharing more of that knowledge on twitter, and in my speaking engagements.
