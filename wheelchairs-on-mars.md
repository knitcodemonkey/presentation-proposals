# Wheelchairs on Mars: AR, VR and A11y

## Abstract:
With AR and VR utilizing mobile devices, the technology is on the verge of exploding into every home, school, mall and doctor's office. This talk challenges universal design, and explores how users with limitations interact differently with the hardware we develop, and the virtual worlds we create.

## Details:

### Problems with Universal Design
* Blind users don't need a visual layer, but an observational layer is desired
* Standing requirements are impossible for those in wheelchairs, or bedridden
* Physical mobility limitations need to use a controller instead of walking and touching
* height scaling?

### Hardware concerns
* Glasses wearers
* Limited mobility users that can't put on or take off the equipment by themselves
    * Blinded by device, or stuck staring at flashing or snowing screens until someone can help
    * Can't reset the program without taking off headset
    * Corded headsets are a safety hazard: fire, strangulation, constriction

### Software considerations
* Height constraints are an issue. 
   * If something is high up, or requires long arms, a person of short stature can't reach (such as a child, or my 4'11" tall aunt)
   * If something is on the ground, there are users that have difficulty standing up (POTS, Elderly, Injured)
* Auditory Sensitivities
    * Audio can be intense for users without auditory triggers, but should be soothing for those that do
    * 360-degree sound is particularly important for users that can't constantly be spinning around to watch their back
* Color indication considerations for color blind users
* Sign/Text/Subtitle reader for illiterate or blind users

## Pitch:

With ARKit and VR utilizing mobile devices, these technologies now have the ability to be in every home, school, and doctor's office. We have the opportunity to develop a budding industry with accessibility as a standard.

Growing up with a deaf mother really instilled in me the desire to help make technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their impediments. I've brought this passion into my day job by advocating for accessibility changes with my own scrum team, and sharing that knowledge with my company as a whole. I have recently begun sharing more of that knowledge on twitter, and in my speaking engagements.
