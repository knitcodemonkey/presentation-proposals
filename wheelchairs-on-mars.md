## Pitch:

With ARKit and VR utilizing mobile devices, these technologies now have the ability to be in every home, school, and doctor's office. We have the opportunity to develop a budding industry with accessibility as a standard.

Growing up with a deaf mother really instilled in me the desire to help make technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their impediments. I've brought this passion into my day job by advocating for accessibility changes with my own scrum team, and sharing that knowledge with my company as a whole. I have recently begun sharing more of that knowledge on twitter, and in my speaking engagements.
