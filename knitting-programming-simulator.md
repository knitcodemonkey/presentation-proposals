# Weaving Tapestries of Code

## Abstract

Yarns, fibers, and fabrics. You have more in common with the weavers of yesteryear than you realize. In this expedition into the past of fiber arts we'll explore how our coding art is the continuation of our ancestors at the loom, how you can learn lessons from their patterns, and maybe a thing or two about that nice sweater you're wearing.

## Details

stories about how fiber arts influenced some technological advances that we take for granted. Cryptogrophy, mathematics, and coding. I want to show users how applicable knitting is to modern coding by creating an app using a knitting pattern as a spec. 

## Pitch
As an artisan knitter, and a long-time programmer, I found that programming came easily to me because of the concepts I'd learned while teaching myself to knit. In the beginning, I was able to use knitting metaphors to make the syntax stick.
