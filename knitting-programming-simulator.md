# Simulate Programming with Knitting

## Abstract
Before pilots are allowed near a plane, they spend time in a flight simulator. Many people don't have easy access to computers. What if there were programming simulators? In this talk, I discuss how knitting patterns and programming are based on the same principals, show you how that knowledge can be applied to a real program, and create an app using a knitting pattern as my only spec.
