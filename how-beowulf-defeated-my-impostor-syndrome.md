# How Beowulf defeated my Impostor Syndrome

## Abstract

## Detail

By suppressing our negative emotions like fear, embarrassment, anger, frustration, exhaustion, etc, we are feeding our own Grendle (Impostor Syndrome). By facing those feelings head on, and allowing them to be satiated by asking questions, taking time off, learning new things, we develop a healthier relationship with our career.

Essentially, imposter syndrome comes from within. Not from tech changing quickly, or from others knowing more than us. It comes from being so afraid to sacrifice our pride that we, in essence, bring our own fears into being.
