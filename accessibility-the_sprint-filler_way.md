# Accessibility: The Sprint-Filler Way

## Abstract:
We see so much information about incorporating accessibility (or a11y) features, but the task seems so daunting, or just not that pressing. Why is a11y important? Where do you get started? What are the quick wins that will give you the biggest bang for your buck? How can we break this down into smaller, sprint-filler-sized pieces? I will answer these questions, share some resources, and discuss the importance of why everyone should focus on a11y. Though this talk is more focused on web and mobile, there are topics discussed that reach far beyond those platforms. Developers, designers, managers, and more can learn how to take the overwhelming task and turn them into smaller, more accessible ones.

## Details:

### Why is accessibility important?

The focus has primarily been on the limited number of permanently disabled people that use the web, but the truth is, we have all been disabled at some point in our lives. By focusing on accessibility features being useful for themselves, and those the interact with everyday, the task becomes more personally important.

### What are the roadblocks keeping you from getting started?

* Don't know where to get started
* Overwhelmed with the huge undertaking of converting legacy code
* Business priority

### How do I get started?

Talk about resources that help you learn, and identify accessibility problems, and how to fix them. aXe extensions, and linting tools are all useful for moving forward with accessibility in mind, and plugging the worst of the problems in legacy code. 

### (Horror) There is so much to do! 

When we are faced with an epic story, we break it down into smaller stories and tasks. This is no different. There are A11y Checklists that give you an idea for how to break these down. 

### It's just not that high of a priority.

Convincing your boss, product owner, and designer can be a hard sell! Armed with information, checklists, and sprint-filler-sized stories you've made from previous section, you can start adding these stories to your sprint. Remember, even one change makes your product more accessible than it was yesterday. 

### Conclusion
Through education, tooling, and iteration, we can all work together to make the web more accessible, one update at a time.

## Pitch:

Accessibility has become a hot topic in recent years, and for good reason! The web has become a deeply engrained part of our lives, and we are excluding people by not allowing them the tools to be able to use it. Inspiring developers is the easy part, but there is still a lot of mystery when it comes to taking the next step. Many devs either don't know much about how to make a site accessible, or the task is so overwhelming that they don't know how to get started. I would like to help change that.

Growing up with a deaf mother really instilled in me the desire to help make technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their impediments. I've brought this passion into my day job by advocating for accessibility changes with my own scrum team, and sharing that knowledge with my company as a whole. I have recently begun sharing more of that knowledge on twitter, and in my speaking engagements.
