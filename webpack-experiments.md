# Webpack Experiments

## Abstract:
Many of us use Webpack to bundle our assets, but once configured, it can be scary to touch it. Through hands-on examples and experimenting with different configurations, you will walk away with an understanding of how flexible Webpack really is, and the confidence to optimize your own project build steps. 

## Details:
* Don't be afraid to experiment. Version control means we can always roll back, or step away and approach it later with a fresh perspective. 
* Start with 3 different configurations.
* Use some analytics tools (like webpack analyzer) to show ways to optimize these bundles. 
* Upgrade to Webpack 4, and improve using one of the cool new features. 
 
## Pitch:
Through my work with OSS, I've seen, and built, a lot of different ways users configure their webpack build steps to get the most out of their bundler. I would like to share with you my passion for making webpack work with you to improve your development process.
