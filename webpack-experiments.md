# Webpack Experiments

## Abstract:
Many of us use Webpack to bundle our assets, but once configured, it can be scary to touch it. Through hands-on examples and experimenting with different configurations, you will walk away with an understanding of how flexible Webpack really is, and the confidence to optimize your own project build steps. 

## Details:
1. Don't be afraid to experiment. Version control means we can always roll back, or step away and approach it later with a fresh perspective. 
2. Optimize 3 different configurations
  A. Webpack/Sass/CSS Modules -> Static website
  B. 
  C. 
Talk about how different configs create different outputs. I thought maybe showing the flexibility of webpack would be a cool way to show people the possibilities, and get them excited about diving in.
3. 
 
## Pitch:
