# Webpack Experiments

## Abstract:
Many of us use Webpack to bundle our assets, but once configured, it can be scary to touch it. Through hands-on examples and experimenting with different configurations, you will walk away with an understanding of how flexible Webpack really is, and the confidence to optimize your own project build steps. 

## Details:
* Don't be afraid to experiment. Version control means we can always roll back, or step away and approach it later with a fresh perspective. 
* Optimize 3 different configurations
  1. Webpack/Sass/CSS Modules -> Static website
  2. 
  3. 
Talk about how different configs create different outputs. I thought maybe showing the flexibility of webpack would be a cool way to show people the possibilities, and get them excited about diving in.
